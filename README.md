# Yoshimaker Tilt Project

This is a simple embedded project showing how to design cross-platform features in C#.  The goal is to keep parity of features with a Meadow F7, Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and a desktop "simulated" environment.

## Video Series

There are YouTube videos covering some of the more interesting parts of the build.
